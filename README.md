# Assets

* Library - Just the DOSE code library files in a given language. Use this for project integration.
* Shell - The DRESS shell will be precompiled and ready to take your datatables as JSON and provide rolling data without any need for compiling. Using the DOSE shell, you can test all chance-based logic of your software before the first line is even written! Or, maybe you just want to use it for tabletop gaming... that's fine too. If you build the JSON structure, the shell will handle the rest.
